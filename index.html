          Hey XYZ
          <br />
          I hope you're doing great! ðŸ˜Š I know this is super last-minute, and I
          feel a little guilty for not planning this better, but I couldn't
          resist reaching out to you. A spontaneous plan just popped up, and I'd
          absolutely love for you to join me on a trip!
          <br />
          It's going to be fun, relaxed, and full of good vibes. I thought of
          you immediately because I know how much better this trip would be with
          you around. I completely understand if you've already got plans, but
          if you're free and up for some adventure, it would mean so much to
          have you come along.
          <br />
          Let me know what you think, and again, I'm sorry for the late notice.
          Fingers crossed you can make it! ðŸ¤ž
          <br />
          Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
